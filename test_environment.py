"""
Test Script for Self-Driving Car Environment

This script helps you verify that your environment implementation is working correctly.
Run this after filling in the blanks in environment.py to test your implementation.

Questions to consider:
- Does the environment reset properly?
- Are observations in the correct format?
- Do actions work as expected?
- Are rewards being computed?
- Does termination work correctly?
